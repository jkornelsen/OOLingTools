* Linguistic Tools add-on for OpenOffice (OOLT)

*******************************************************************************

OOLT provides a menu of tools for linguistic writeups and other documents
written in lesser-known languages.

For help, see Linguistics -> Help.

* Requirements
*******************************************************************************

LibreOffice (LO) or Apache OpenOffice (AOO) is required.  The add-on supports
both brands equally, and in this document, the name OpenOffice refers
generically to both.  There is no python support in AOO 4.0 so please upgrade
to AOO 4.1 or higher.  OOLT is tested on Windows and Linux.  It should work on
a Mac as well.

For Data Conversion on Windows, download and install the SIL Converters
application.  On Linux, install FieldWorks which includes the required SIL
Converters libraries.

In addition to English, this add-on can be used in Spanish or French.  It
should change automatically when you use OpenOffice in one of those
languages (Tools -> Options -> Language Settings, Languages).

The latest release of the add-on can be downloaded from
http://projects.palaso.org/projects/ooolt.


*******************************************************************************
* Installation
*******************************************************************************

The add-on is installed from a file called LinguisticTools.oxt. When you
open this file, the OpenOffice Extensions Manager will install it. After it
finishes, open a Writer document. If the installation was
successful, you will see a new menu to the right of the Tools menu called
"Linguistics" as shown in Overview above.

If the extension is not able to install correctly, close all open windows of
OpenOffice including the quickstarter and then try again.

When installing OpenOffice in Windows, the Python-UNO bridge must be selected.
This is under Optional components and is selected by default.  In Fedora, the
Python bridge is not included by default.  You must add either the
libreoffice-pyuno or python-openoffice package.

If there is an older version of the add-on installed, the Extension Manager
will first remove the old version.  You may see an error when removing that
says "Addons.xcu does not exist." Just ignore this error and press ok.  To
prevent this error, you can delete the user profile
(check Tools -> Options -> Paths for the location), which will remove any
existing add-ons and settings.

Sometimes removing an older version may give other error messages such as
failing to close a bridge. If there are error messages like this, then close
all open windows of OpenOffice. Then try removing the older version again. You
may also need to reboot in order for this problem to go away.  Some people have
reported that re-downloading the extension was needed, especially in areas
where there is a poor internet connection.
