Number 1.8 is slow.

It seems to be slow after a certain number of frames are on a page.
One solution that seems to work for frames is to insert a hard newline.
So it could be inserted after e.g. 20 outer frames and somehow later removed.
What about tables?  I'm not sure there's actually a problem with tables; it just takes
a little more time with larger examples.

Ok, two things seem to be causing the slowness:
1. It takes more time to render a lot of frames without a newline.
2. It takes more time to resize the table cell each time an inner table is
   resized.
3. It takes more time to render frames inside a table cell that
   doesn't have any more room.  Or just resizing takes time?

Corresponding solutions:
1. Add newlines after 20 frames, then delete the newlines afterwards.
2. Set the outer table height to 20 inches at first, then auto resize
   at the end.
3. Set the outer table height to fixed at first, then auto resize
   at the end.

Solution 1 is not too difficult, and does not slow down ordinary data.
Solution 2 is not as good for normal size data. To fix this:
- if there are more than a certain number of morphemes (say 20), then make a
  larger fixed-size table.
  Of course this is only an educated guess, although we could guess better by
  taking into account the base font size and number of rows.

Frame times:
- 44 counts with IsAutoHeight True
- 16 counts with Height 10 or more
- 18 counts with Height 5
- 20 counts with Height 2
Setting a low height is still pretty fast.

How about this solution:
- add newlines for a lot of frames.
- start with a fairly low fixed height, perhaps 1/3 page = 3.5in
- have a user variable that can force a different starting size if non-empty
  (or non-zero perhaps)
  Well, why not always use the user variable, and set it to 3.5 by default

Regardless of whether or not large data is common,
it seems perfectly reasonable to start with a fixed size while doing so much
manipulating, and then resize at the end.

Question: Should number of frames be based on outer frames only?
          This probably should be tested.
          Conclusion: The count should include inner frames too.

INSERT_NEWLINE_AFTER = 30
self.top_row.Height = 3 * 2540 # inches
Removing added newlines must be done AFTER a call to resizeOuterTable().
